# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It uses

- Chakra for styling
- Redux for state management
- Uses Axios internally for Api calls

## Running the app

Here are the steps to follow to run the frontend server.

1. Install Node.js and NPM: To get started with NestJS, you will need Node.js and NPM installed on your system. You can download and install Node.js from the official website https://nodejs.org/en/.

2. Install dependencies: Once the repository has been cloned, navigate to the project (`./frontend`) directory in your terminal and run the following command to install the project dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

3. Start the development server: After the dependencies have been installed, run the following command to start the development server:

```bash
$ npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the app in your default web browser.
